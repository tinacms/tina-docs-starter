# Tina Documentation Starter

This Next.js starter is powered by TinaCMS and based upon [Smooth Doc](https://github.com/lwz7512/next-smooth-doc) it allows you and your team to create beautiful docs powered by MDX.



## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Tina Headless CMS for authentication, content modeling, visual editing and team management.
- Cloudinary to manage your media.
- MDX component support for easy to use resuable components
- Vercel deployment to visually edit your site from the /admin route.
- Local development workflow from the filesystem with a local GraqhQL server.
- Docs powered by https://docsearch.algolia.com/

  
## Requirements

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Yarn installed for local development.
- A [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) account for live editing.
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account for media support.

## Local development

Install the project's dependencies:

``` bash
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```
### Local URLs

- http://localhost:3000/docs/ : browse the website 
- http://localhost:3000/admin : connect to Tina Cloud and go in edit mode
- http://localhost:3000/exit-admin : log out of Tina Cloud
- http://localhost:4001/altair/ : GraphQL playground to test queries and browse the API documentation


## Wanting to use Doc search?

The first step is to apply for [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/). Once that is done you can update the `/config/siteMetadata.js` with the apiKey and Index.

```json
docSearch: {
    apiKey: 'API_KEY',
    indexName: 'INDEX_NAME',
  },
```
Once you do that, search will appear in the header.
